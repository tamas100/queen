      <h1>Freddie Mercury</h1>

      <p>Born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 - 24 November 1991</p>

      <article>
        Freddie is one of the most successful vocalists and songwriters in the
        world, and is generally regarded as the best frontman of any band. He
        has written some of Queen's biggest hits and enjoyed a moderately
        successful solo career.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        Farookh Bulsara was born in Zanzibar in 1946, and the family moved to
        India in 1947, where Farookh would eventually attend boarding school in
        Bombay. Whilst there, he won awards for boxing and table tennis, and
        joined his first band, 'The Hectics', in 1959, playing the piano. His
        family moved to London in 1963, due to a political uprising. He then
        attended Ealing College of Art, becoming friends with fellow student Tim
        Staffell, and eventually obtaining a diploma in Graphic Art & Design.

        <h2>Career outside the Queen</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Early years</h3>
          Freddie joined his first UK band in 1969, 'Ibex'. In September 1969,
          Ibex were joined on stage by Smile, presumably the first meeting
          between Freddie, Brian and Roger. The group eventually broke up in
          October 1969. Freddie's second band, 'Wreckage', were formed in
          October 1969, and they played a handful of concerts in the UK before
          splitting up, in early 1970. Freddie's third band was 'Sour Milk Sea',
          but they only lasted until around March 1970. Freddie had become a big
          fan of the group 'Smile', but his friend Tim Staffell left the group
          in March. Freddie then endlessly pestered Roger and Brian to join the
          group, telling them what they should be doing. Freddie changed his
          name from Farookh Bulsara to the more glamorous Freddie Mercury, named
          after the messenger of the Gods.

          <h3>Solo career</h3>
          In 1985, Freddie released his first solo album, 'Mr Bad Guy', which
          reached an impressive number 6 in the chart. February 1987 saw the
          release of 'The Great Pretender', a cover version of The Platters 1956
          hit. The track soon became Freddie's most successful single so far,
          reaching number 4 in the UK charts. Freddie and Montserrat Caballe
          released their album Barcelona in the UK in October 1988.
