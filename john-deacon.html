            <h3>Early years</h3>
            John formed his first group in 1965 called 'Opposition', in which he originally played guitar.
            In April 1966 he took up playing the bass, and in the same year the group had a name change to 'The New Opposition'.
            In 1967, the name changed back to 'Opposition' and in 1968 to 'Art'. The group eventually broke up in late 1969.
            John was also part of a three-piece band called 'Deacon' which were formed, and broke up, within November 1970,
            having performed just one show.

            'No Turning Back' was released as a single in 1986, and was used in the film 'Biggles'.
