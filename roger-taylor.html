            <h3>Early years</h3>
            He joined his first group in 1965, called 'Johnny Quale and The Reaction',
            but when lead singer Johnny Quale left the same year,Roger took over lead vocals for 'The Reaction',
            which lasted until July 1968. Later in 1968, Roger decided he wanted to become a dentist,
            and enrolled on a course at London Hospital Medical School. 
            However, he eventually left to study Plant and Animal Biology at North London Polytechnic.
            It was in 1968 that Roger auditioned for Tim Staffell and Brian May, who were looking for a 'Ginger Baker type drummer'.
            Roger passed the audition and became the drummer for 'Smile', who played many concerts until 1970, when Tim Staffell left.

            <h3>Solo career</h3>
            In August 1977, Roger became the first member of Queen to produce solo work.
            His debut single was a reworking of a track titled 'I Wanna Testify', but this failed to make an impact on the chart.
            His next solo venture was his 'Fun In Space' album, in 1981. Roger's second solo album came in 1984, titled 'Strange Frontier'.
            In 1987 Roger decided that for his new album, the tracks had to be performed live in the studio,
            so he embarked on selecting four musicians for the band, and the result, 'The Cross', released three albums between 1988 and 1991.
            It wasn't until 1994 that Roger's next album was released. 'Happiness?' reached no 22 in the chart and gave Roger three top-30 hit singles.
            Roger's next album 'Electric Fire' was released in September 1998.
            In November 2013, Roger released his long-awaited fifth album, titled 'Fun On Earth'.
